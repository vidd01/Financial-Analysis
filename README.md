# Financial-Analysis
In this project, I analyzed the data to create an interactive Dashboard to make Intelligent Business decisions

## Intro
Microsoft PowerApps are great tools for developing applications for various use cases. Power BI is a powerful tool for data analysis and visualization. Financial analysis is the process of identifying which country or region has the highest revenue and their average revenue shown quarterly and monthly. This can help businesses to understand which country or region has less revenue or income based on that result they can improve their country's economy effectively. 

## About this project
- I connected to Excel data sources and imported the relevant tables into Power BI.
- I have modified the data to get the required result by changing the data type of the field.
- I have created measures such as Average revenue, Total country, total revenue, and total transaction.
- Prepared reports with slicers for years, Qatar and Rank, visuals such as donut, line with columns, treemap, matrix, Ribbon chart, card, and area chart.

## ETL
- Most of the tables had null values in their records, The Fact table has interdependent variables hence it was necessary to eliminate these records.
- The data type of the variables year, Qatar, ranks into numeric
- To help Business users understand the data easily I have added another column Average revenue, Total country, total revenue, and total transaction.
